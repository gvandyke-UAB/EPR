RoadmapTemplate.m is meant to be used as a kind of standard for roadmap generation. The roadmap text files that it generates are ready to plot in Origin. When you import them (Ctrl + K) into Origin, make sure to select "Show Options Dialog" in the file explorer that pops up. In "Import Options" go to "Columns" and change the "Column Designations" dropdown box to [XY].
