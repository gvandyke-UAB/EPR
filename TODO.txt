TODO:

-As experimentalists, how do we determine the cause of an effect that could be brought about through multiple interactions, but yield the same net result? (g-strain or D-strain?)

-Why is the angular data labeled intensity when it's the derivative of absorption?

-How would we probe D-strain? Or are we just using D-strain as the most likely candidate for what we see, then choosing the best value for it?
