Basics of Git:

-Your computer now believes it is the repo that you got from the GitHub website
-You control when and what updates occur, unlike a cloud system where updates are instant
-If you want to "update" your repo on your machine, which is like "re-copying" from the 	main repo on the website, use 'git pull'
-If you want to publish your changes to the website, stage your changes for commitment 		with 'git add .', then 'git commit -m "summary of what you did"', then 'git push'.
-If you're not comfortable with the terminal commands, you can use the "Git GUI here" 		option instead
