TODO:

-Normalize all angle measurements to one line (if roadmaps had an intensity dimension, normalize that)
	-Find a more general & functional technique so the code is more easily reused

-Ask about line widths from resfields on forum

-Get angular dependent Fe3+ and Fe2+ data (RT and 30K) from Suman, compare to roadmap predictions for Cr and Fe3+
