% The following function takes two CSV-style .txt files and horizontally
% concatenates them.

function finaltxt = combinetxt(x,y)
% if the matrices we want to combine into one .txt file are of different
% size, insert NaN at the bottom of the shorter one until they match length
if size(x,1) == size(y,1)
    finaltxt = [x,y]; % if they're compatible sizes, great
elseif size(x,1) > size(y,1) % if the first one is bigger, pad the second one with NaNs
    numNans = size(x,1) - size(y,1);
    rowofnans = nan(size(y,2));
    for i = 1:numNans
        y = [y;rowofnans];
    end
    finaltxt = [x,y];
elseif size(x,1) < size(y,1)
    numNans = size(y,1) - size(x,1);
    rowofnans = nan(1,size(x,2));
    for i = 1:numNans
        x = [x;rowofnans];
    end
    finaltxt = [x,y];
end

% first two rows are name and units
names = {};
units = {};
for i = 1:size(finaltxt,2)/2
    names = horzcat(names, {'Magnetic Field', 'Angle'});
    units = horzcat(units, {'Gauss', 'Degrees'});   
end

finaltxt = [names; units; num2cell(finaltxt)];

end

% The following function takes resfield and rho data and turns it into a
% CSV-style .txt file

function resfieldsCSV = makeResfieldsCSVtxt(xdata, rho, filename)
% For some reason, the resfields function returns duplicated data, so first
% we cut our matrix in half
desiredBresRows = size(xdata,1)/2;
Bresdata = xdata(1:desiredBresRows, 1:size(xdata,2))';

% Crete angle matrix
ydata = rho * 180/pi -90;
ydata = ydata'; % Transpose it

% initialize data as the x & y coordinates from the first trace
resfieldsCSV = [Bresdata(:,1)*10 ydata];

% this loop adds however other many traces there are
for i = 2:desiredBresRows
    resfieldsCSV = [resfieldsCSV Bresdata(:,i)*10 ydata];
end

save(strcat(filename, 'Roadmap.txt'),'resfieldsCSV','-ascii');

end

% The following function takes in a matrix and normalizes its values to 1
function [normalizedMatrix, maxVal] = normInt(Matrix)

maxVal = Matrix(1,1);

for i = 1:size(Matrix,1)
    for j = 1:size(Matrix,2)
        if maxVal <= Matrix(i,j)
            maxVal = Matrix(i,j);
        end
